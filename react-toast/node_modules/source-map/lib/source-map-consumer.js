/**
 * A BasicSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can

 * position in the generated source.
 *
 * The first parameter is the raw source map (either as a JSON string, or
 * already parsed to an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
 * following attributes:
 *
 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
 *   - sources: An array of URLs to the original source files.
 *   - names: An array of identifiers which can be referenced by individual mappings.
 *   - sourceRoot: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
 *   - sourcesContent: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
 *   - mappings: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
 *
 * Here is an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0]:
 *
 *     {
 *       version : 3,
 *       file: "out.js",
 *       sourceRoot : "",
 *       sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
 *       names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
 *       mappings: "AA,AB;;ABCDE;"
 *     }
 *
 * The second parameter, if given, is a string whose value is the URL
 * at which the source map was found.  This URL is used to compute the
 * sources array.
